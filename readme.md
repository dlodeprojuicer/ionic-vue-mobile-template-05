[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2fbd5ca0-34f6-4f79-903c-74e40d8d8892/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ionic-vue-mobile-template-05/deploys)

Hybrid mobile template built with Ionic Vue using capacitor for native builds.

Template is based on [TechConf-db.com](https://techconf-db.com), a side project of mine. Unlike other templetes, this one is not meant to be a mobile app, atleast not yet, but it is responsive and can be used as a mobile app. 

[Demo](https://ionic-vue-mobile-template-05.netlify.app)

## Features
- Vuex
- Firebase
- Mailchimp
- Search Filter
- Responsive

## Configs
For this template, I created static data. Techconf-db is using a Firebase backend. Replace Firebase config in `src/firebase.js` or remove Firebase completely to use your prefer your a different backend.

Also, make sure you replace Mailchimp config URL on line 123 of `src/components/Subscription.vue`

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run on the browser - development
```
npm run serve
```

## Native

Using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started) for native builds

## Prepare native builds

### iOS testing and distribution
1. Download the latest Xcode
2. `npm run build`
3. `npx cap add ios`
3. `npx cap copy`
4. `npx cap open ios` Xcode takes a few seconds to index the files; keep an eye at the top of Xcode's window for progress.

[Not compulsory] For sanity check click on the play button in the top left. This will prepare and run the app in a simulator, if all goes well you should be able to run the app and click around. If not, create an issue ü§∑ and I will have a look.

### Android testing and distribution
1. Download the latest Android Studio
2. `npm run build`
3. `npx cap add android`
3. `npx cap copy`
4. `npx cap open android` Android Studio takes a few seconds to index the files, keep an eye at the bottom of Android Studio for progress.
5. Testing - When indexing is complete, look for a green play button. Click the play button and it will launch the app in an emulator ([See here to setup Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)) or on the phone, if a phone is connected via USB.
